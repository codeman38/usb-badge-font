Fonts in this directory are taken from the following sources:

ledbadge.lcd
* Taken directly from the official driver for the Inland LED Badge,
  available at <http://ipsgproducts.com/products/electronics/LED_badge.htm>.

pressstart.lcd
* My own "Press Start" font's source <http://www.zone38.net/font/>.

normal.lcd, bold.lcd, special.lcd
* PC Paint, released legally as free abandonware
  <http://www.shdon.com/software/pcpaint>.

Original 8x8 versions of all but ledbadge.lcd are in the "8x8" subdirectory
(with necessary modifications to fit them into a 7-pixel height). These can
be edited in a sprite editor such as Tile Layer or YYchr, and were converted
to the .lcd format using font2lcd.py.

ledbadge.lcd can be extracted from the original Inland driver executable
using extractexe.py.
